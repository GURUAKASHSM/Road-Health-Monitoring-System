# Road Health Monitoring Project

## Overview

The Road Health Monitoring Project is a state-of-the-art infrastructure monitoring system that aims to enhance road safety and streamline maintenance operations. It leverages modern technology, including cameras, IoT sensors, and machine learning algorithms, to continuously assess and report the condition of road networks in real-time. This README provides an overview of the project, its key features, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Collection**: Continuous monitoring of road conditions through a network of sensors and cameras.

- **Machine Learning-Based Defect Detection**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to detect and categorize road defects, such as potholes, cracks, and surface wear.

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predicts potential road failures and recommends maintenance schedules, leading to cost savings and efficient resource allocation.

- **Real-time Alerts**: Sends instant alerts to relevant authorities when critical issues are detected, allowing for swift response and intervention.

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Maintains an extensive archive of historical road health data for trend analysis and long-term infrastructure planning.
